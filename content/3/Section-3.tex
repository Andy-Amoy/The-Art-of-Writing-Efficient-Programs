In this section, you get to apply the knowledge you have learned so far to the practice of writing C++ programs. You will learn which language features help achieve better performance, which ones can lead to unexpected inefficiencies, and how to help the compiler generate better object code. Finally, you will study the art of designing programs with an eye on performance.

本节包括以下几章:

\begin{itemize}
\item 第9章，High-Performance C++
\item 第10章，Compiler Optimizations in C++
\item 第11章，Undefined Behavior and Performance
\item 第12章，Design for Performance
\end{itemize}
