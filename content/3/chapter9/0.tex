In this chapter, we switch focus from the optimal use of the hardware resources to the optimal application of a particular programming language. While everything we have learned so far can be applied, usually quite straightforwardly, to any program in any language, this chapter deals with C++ features and idiosyncrasies. You will learn which features of the C++ language are likely to cause performance problems and how to avoid them. 

In this chapter, weâ€™re going to cover the following main topics:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Efficiency and overhead of the C++ language

\item
Learning to notice likely inefficiencies in the use of C++ language constructs

\item
Avoiding inefficient C++ code

\item
Optimizing memory access and conditional operations 
	
\end{itemize}
