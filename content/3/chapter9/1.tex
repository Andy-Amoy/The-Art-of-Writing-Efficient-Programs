Again, you will need a C++ compiler and a micro-benchmarking tool, such as the Google Benchmark library we used in the previous chapter (found at \url{https://github.com/google/benchmark}). The code accompanying this chapter can be found at \url{https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-Art-of-Writing-Efficient-Programs/tree/master/Chapter09}.

You will also need a way to examine the assembly code generated by the compiler: many development environments have an option to display assembly; GCC and Clang can write out the assembly instead of the object code; debuggers and other tools can generate assembly from the object code (disassemble it). It's a matter of personal preference which tool you use.
