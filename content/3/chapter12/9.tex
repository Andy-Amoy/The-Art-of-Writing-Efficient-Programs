\begin{enumerate}
\item 
What is design for performance?

\item 
How do we make sure that the interfaces do not restrict optimal implementation?

\item 
Why do interfaces that communicate the client's intent allow for better performance?

\item
How can we make informed performance-related design decisions when we have no performance measurements?
