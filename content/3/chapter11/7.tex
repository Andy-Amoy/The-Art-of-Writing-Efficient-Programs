\begin{enumerate}
\item 
What is undefined behavior?

\item 
Why can't we define the results for any situation the program may encounter?

\item 
If I write code the standard labels as UB, test the result, and verify that the code works, I'm OK, right?

\item
Why would I want to intentionally design a program that has documented undefined behavior?
