As before, you will need a C++ compiler. In this chapter, we use GCC and Clang, but any modern compiler will do. The code accompanying this chapter can be found at \url{https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-Art-of-WritingEfficient-Programs/tree/master/Chapter11}. You will also need a way to examine the assembly code generated by the compiler. Many development environments have an option to display assembly code, GCC and Clang can write out the assembly code instead of the object code, debuggers and other tools can generate assembly code from the object code (disassemble it); it's a matter of personal preference which tool you use.
