Again, you will need a C++ compiler and a micro-benchmarking tool, such as the Google Benchmark library we used in the previous chapter (found at \url{https://github.com/google/benchmark}). The code accompanying this chapter can be found at \url{https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-Art-of-Writing-EfficientPrograms/tree/master/Chapter10}.

You will also need a way to examine the assembly code generated by the compiler. Many development environments have an option to display assembly, GCC and Clang can write out the assembly instead of the object code, debuggers and other tools can generate assembly from the object code (disassemble it). It's a matter of personal preference which tool you use.
