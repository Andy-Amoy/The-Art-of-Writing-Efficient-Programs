\begin{enumerate}
\item Why is program performance important despite advances in processing power?
\item Why does understanding software performance require low-level knowledge of the computing hardware and programming languages?
\item What is the difference between performance and efficiency?
\item Why must performance be defined with respect to specific metrics?
\item How can we judge whether the performance-related goals for specific metrics are accomplished?
