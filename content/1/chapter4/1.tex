Again, you will need a C++ compiler and a micro-benchmarking tool, such as the Google Benchmark library we used in the previous chapter (found at \url{https://github.com/google/benchmark}). We will also use the LLVM Machine Code Analyzer (LLVMMCA), found at \url{https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-mca.html}. If you want to use the MCA, your choice of compilers is more limited: you need an LLVM-based compiler such as Clang.
