\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the key to using the CPU resources efficiently?
\item How can we use instruction-level parallelism to improve performance?
\item How can the CPU execute computations in parallel if the latter one needs the results of the former one?
\item Why are conditional branches much more expensive than simply the cost of evaluating a conditional expression?
\item What is speculative execution?
\item What optimization techniques are available to improve the effectiveness of pipelining in code with conditional computations?
